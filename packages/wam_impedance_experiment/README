To run experiment, use the roslaunch file as follows:

  roslaunch wam_impedance_experiment experiment.launch

This will default to subject number 0.  To specify a subject number, use the following:

  roslaunch simulation_impedance_experiment experiment.launch n:=1

In this example, the subject number is set to 1.  

(RECOMMENDED) To print node output to the terminal, add the --screen option:

  roslaunch simulation_impedance_experiment experiment.launch n:=1 --screen
