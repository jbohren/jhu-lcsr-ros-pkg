    Stack for integrating the Computer-Integrated Surgical Systems and Technology (CISST) Libraries with ROS systems and the ROS build system. CISST is a collection of libraries used in realtime sensor processing, computation, and robot control. It is developed by the Lab for Computational Sensing and Robotics at The Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. For more information about this distribution of the CISST libraries, see the cisst ROS package within this stack.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TODO:
      [ ] Make separate build targets and proxy ROS packages instead of the single monolithic cisst ROS package, so that CISST libraries do not ALL have to be built. This can be done by building the libraries one (or more) at a time, while obeying the dependencies and installing them into different ROS packages. Then, when a user wishes to use just _part_ of CISST without changing the CISST build configuration, he or she can add only the relevant parts to his or her manifest.xml.

      [ ] Update doxygen config file (lots of old vars in there) "doxygen -u"

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
