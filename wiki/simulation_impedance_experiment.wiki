#summary variable-impedance virtual prosthesis experiment code

= Introduction =

This package contains the code needed to run the virtual prosthesis experiment associated with the following paper submitted to ICRA 2012:

A. Blank, A. M. Okamura, and L. L. Whitcomb. User comprehension of task performance with varying impedance in a virtual prosthetic arm. IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2012. Submitted.

_Under construction!_

== Requirements ==

Hardware:
  * Two data acquisition cards with analog input and output, for example, [http://www.mccdaq.com/pci-data-acquisition/PCI-DAS6014.aspx here]. (Code can be easily modified to use one card, if it has enough output pins.)
  

Software:
  * [http://www.comedi.org Comedi] - to interface with two data acquisition cards for controlling hardware
  * [http://www.opengl.org OpenGL] with [http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/ GLUT] - for graphics.
