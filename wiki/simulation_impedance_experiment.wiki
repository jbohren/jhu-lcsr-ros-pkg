#summary variable-impedance virtual prosthesis experiment code

= Introduction =

This package contains the code needed to run the virtual prosthesis experiment associated with the following paper submitted to ICRA 2012:

A. Blank, A. M. Okamura, and L. L. Whitcomb. User comprehension of task performance with varying impedance in a virtual prosthetic arm. IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2012. Submitted.


= Details =

_Under construction!_

== Requirements ==

Hardware:
  * Two data acquisition cards with analog input and output, for example, [http://www.mccdaq.com/pci-data-acquisition/PCI-DAS6014.aspx here]. (Code can be easily modified to use one card, if it has enough output pins.)

Software:
  * [http://www.comedi.org Comedi]
  * [http://www.opengl.org OpenGL] with [http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/ GLUT]
  * [http://www.gnu.org/s/gsl/ GSL]

== Download ==

To check out this package from svn, 
{{{
svn checkout http://jhu-lcsr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/pkgs/trunk/simulation_impedance_experiment simulation_impedance_experiment
}}}

== Build ==

{{{
rosdep install simulation_impedance_experiment
}}}

{{{
rosmake simulation_impedance_experiment
}}}

== Run ==

The experiment uses four nodes, which should be started in this order:

  * daq - interfaces with data acquisition card for reading force sensor input and providing tactor output
  * simulation - simulates 1-dof virtual prosthesis and handles data logging
  * graphics - provides visual feedback and instructions to the experiment subject
  * experiment_manager - 

Something about data logging format...
