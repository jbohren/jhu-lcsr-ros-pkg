#summary variable-impedance virtual prosthesis experiment code

_Under construction!_

= Introduction =

This package contains the code needed to run the virtual prosthesis experiment associated with the following paper submitted to ICRA 2012:

A. Blank, A. M. Okamura, and L. L. Whitcomb. User comprehension of task performance with varying impedance in a virtual prosthetic arm. IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2012. Submitted.

= Requirements =

Hardware:
  * Two data acquisition cards with analog input and output, for example, [http://www.mccdaq.com/pci-data-acquisition/PCI-DAS6014.aspx here]. (Code can be easily modified to use one card, if it has enough output pins.)

Software:
  * [http://www.comedi.org Comedi]
  * [http://www.opengl.org OpenGL] with [http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/ GLUT]
  * [http://www.gnu.org/s/gsl/ GSL]

= Download =

Export the code from svn:
{{{
svn export http://jhu-lcsr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/pkgs/trunk/simulation_impedance_experiment simulation_impedance_experiment
}}}

= Build =

Make sure the necessary dependencies are installed:
{{{
rosdep install simulation_impedance_experiment
}}}

Then build the package:
{{{
rosmake simulation_impedance_experiment
}}}

= Run =

The experiment uses four nodes, which should be started in this order:

  * daq - interfaces with data acquisition card for reading force sensor input and providing tactor output
  * simulation - simulates 1-dof virtual prosthesis and handles data logging
  * graphics - provides visual feedback and instructions to the experiment subject, and handles keyboard input
  * experiment_manager - handles experiment trials, selects feedback methods, etc.

Experiment data is logged by the simulation node, and written into m-files at the end of each trial. Data files are located in data/Subjectxx/ and are named with the set and trial number as Setxx_Trialxx.m. Rating data written at the end of the experiment into a single m-file, data/Subjectxx/all_ratings.m.
